# web_crawler

A web crawler built in Java to gather website keywords for a search engine. Compliant with the robots.txt.

The web crawler gathers keywords, titles, and summaries, lemmatizes them, and adds them to a SQLite database with an index.

Currently, it is restricted to Wikipedia pages to give better results for a custom search engine, but it can be changed slightly to work for any website on the internet.
